# PHP_blog

This blog is based on the **MVC**(model - view - controller) standard, you can use the most recent php version or an old one, it does not change anything.
As I typed in the repository's title, I made this project at school, this is a good starting point for people who don't know how to implement the **MVC** logic in php.

## Why there are two languages in the project ?

I made this project for an italian teacher initially then I started to apply some changes, but in the next days I am going to add two different version, one in english and the other one in italian language.

## What do I need to make the Blog work correctly ?

You just need **Apache** and **Mysql** both installed on your computer, create a new database called **its_blog** then you have to import from the **dao** folder, which is inside the app folder, the **its_blog.sql** file.
